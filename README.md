**Project Overview:**
This project predicts whether the weather conditions in Oslo are suitable for a BBQ day. It is designed as an industry-style end-to-end ML pipeline using scikit-learn Pipelines + Deep Learning, with modularized code for maintainability and reproducibility.

Kaggle Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/weather-prediction/data


**The pipeline covers:**
- Data loading & cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (Month, Season)
- Preprocessing via Pipelines (scaling + encoding)
- Multi-model training (LogReg, RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, ANN)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrices, SHAP explainability)

**Workflow:**

**1. Data Preprocessing**
Loaded weather dataset + BBQ outcome labels (OSLO_BBQ_weather).
Converted DATE column to datetime.

Created additional features:
- Day
- Season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall)
Merged with BBQ labels.


**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
KDE plots for cloud cover, wind, humidity, sunshine, temperature, pressure, radiation, precipitation.
Correlation heatmap to study relationships.


**3. Feature Engineering**
Added derived categorical feature Season.
Defined numeric vs. categorical features for preprocessing.


**4. Preprocessing Pipeline**
StandardScaler â†’ numeric features
OneHotEncoder â†’ categorical features (Season)
Wrapped in a ColumnTransformer.


**5. Models Trained**
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
 -XGBoost
- LightGBM
- Neural Net (Keras Sequential wrapped with KerasClassifier)
Each model runs inside the same pipeline, ensuring consistent preprocessing.


**6. Model Evaluation**
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
Confusion Matrix (plotted via utils.plot_confusion)
Feature Importance:
- RandomForest â†’ .feature_importances_
- XGBoost â†’ plot_importance

Explainability:
- SHAP TreeExplainer on RandomForest
